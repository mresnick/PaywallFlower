# Smart Bypass Architecture - Scalable Paywall Solution

## Overview

This document describes the new scalable paywall bypass architecture implemented to address reliability issues with archive.org and other bypass services. The solution provides intelligent method selection, domain-specific strategies, health monitoring, and adaptive learning.

## Problem Statement

The original PaywallFlower system used a simple linear fallback chain:
1. Archive.today
2. Wayback Machine (archive.org)
3. Browser extraction

**Issues identified:**
- Archive.org has reliability issues with certain domains
- No intelligence in method selection
- No learning from success/failure patterns
- Limited bypass methods available
- No health monitoring or automatic failover

## Solution Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Plugin-Based Architecture

**Base Class: [`BypassMethod`](src/services/bypassMethods/BypassMethod.js)**
- Standardized interface for all bypass methods
- Built-in metrics tracking and health monitoring
- Configurable timeouts, priorities, and retry logic
- Automatic success rate calculation

**Registry: [`BypassMethodRegistry`](src/services/BypassMethodRegistry.js)**
- Manages all bypass method instances
- Auto-discovery and registration of new methods
- Health check orchestration
- Method lifecycle management

#### 2. Enhanced Bypass Methods

**Archive Services:**
- [`ArchiveTodayMethod`](src/services/bypassMethods/ArchiveTodayMethod.js) - Archive.today/Archive.ph
- [`WaybackMethod`](src/services/bypassMethods/WaybackMethod.js) - Internet Archive (with reliability warnings)

**Bypass Services:**
- [`TwelveFtMethod`](src/services/bypassMethods/TwelveFtMethod.js) - 12ft.io paywall bypass
- [`OutlineMethod`](src/services/bypassMethods/OutlineMethod.js) - Outline.com article extraction
- [`GoogleCacheMethod`](src/services/bypassMethods/GoogleCacheMethod.js) - Google cached pages

**Browser Extraction:**
- [`BrowserMethod`](src/services/bypassMethods/BrowserMethod.js) - Enhanced Puppeteer extraction

#### 3. Intelligence Layer

**Metrics Tracking: [`BypassMetrics`](src/services/BypassMetrics.js)**
- Domain-specific success rate tracking
- Performance metrics (response time, reliability)
- Trending analysis and failure pattern detection
- Automatic method blacklisting for problematic domains

**Smart Orchestrator: [`SmartBypassService`](src/services/SmartBypassService.js)**
- Intelligent method prioritization
- Domain-specific strategy management
- Adaptive learning from user feedback
- Rate limiting and resource management

#### 4. Health Monitoring

**Circuit Breaker Pattern:**
- Automatic method disabling when failure rates exceed thresholds
- Recovery detection and re-enabling
- Cascading failure prevention

**Health Checks:**
- Periodic service availability testing
- Performance degradation detection
- Automatic failover to healthy methods

### Method Prioritization Strategy

#### Default Priority Order (1-10, higher = preferred):
1. **Archive.today (9)** - Fast, reliable for recent content
2. **12ft.io (8)** - Effective for many news sites
3. **Outline.com (7)** - Good content extraction and formatting
4. **Google Cache (6)** - Reliable but may have older content
5. **Wayback Machine (4)** - Known reliability issues with news sites
6. **Browser Extraction (3)** - Resource intensive, last resort

#### Domain-Specific Overrides:

**New York Times (nytimes.com):**
- Preferred: 12ft.io → Outline.com → Browser Extraction
- Blacklisted: Wayback Machine (consistently fails)

**Wall Street Journal (wsj.com):**
- Preferred: Archive.today → 12ft.io → Google Cache
- Blacklisted: Wayback Machine

**Financial Times (ft.com):**
- Preferred: Archive.today → Google Cache → Browser Extraction
- Blacklisted: Wayback Machine

### Configuration Management

**Method Configuration: [`src/config/bypassMethods.json`](src/config/bypassMethods.json)**
```json
{
  "methods": {
    "archive_today": {
      "enabled": true,
      "priority": 9,
      "timeout": 10000
    },
    "12ft_io": {
      "enabled": true,
      "priority": 8,
      "timeout": 15000
    }
  },
  "domainOverrides": {
    "nytimes.com": {
      "preferredMethods": ["12ft_io", "outline_com", "browser_extraction"],
      "blacklistedMethods": ["wayback_machine"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Adaptive Learning System

#### Success Rate Tracking
- **Global Metrics:** Overall method performance across all domains
- **Domain-Specific Metrics:** Method effectiveness per domain
- **Recent Performance:** Weighted toward recent attempts (last 20 attempts)
- **User Feedback Integration:** Manual feedback affects method prioritization

#### Strategy Updates
- **Automatic Blacklisting:** Methods with >90% failure rate over 10+ attempts
- **Priority Adjustment:** Successful methods move up in domain-specific lists
- **Recovery Detection:** Previously blacklisted methods get second chances

### Health Monitoring & Circuit Breakers

#### Health Check System
- **Periodic Checks:** Every 5 minutes by default
- **Test URLs:** Each method defines appropriate test URLs
- **Failure Thresholds:** 3 consecutive failures = unhealthy
- **Recovery Thresholds:** 2 consecutive successes = healthy

#### Circuit Breaker Implementation
```javascript
// Automatic method disabling
if (consecutiveFailures >= 3) {
  method.healthStatus.healthy = false;
  // Method excluded from selection until recovery
}
```

### Performance Optimizations

#### Parallel Processing
- Fast methods (archive services) can run concurrently
- Resource-intensive methods (browser) run sequentially
- Configurable concurrency limits per method type

#### Caching & Deduplication
- Recent successful bypasses cached for 1 hour
- Duplicate URL requests within 5 minutes use cached results
- Request deduplication prevents redundant processing

#### Resource Management
- Browser extraction limited to 2 concurrent sessions
- Rate limiting: 3 requests per URL per minute
- Automatic cleanup of expired data and connections

## Migration Strategy

### Backward Compatibility
- **Legacy Support:** Original [`PaywallBypassService`](src/services/paywallBypassService.js) remains functional
- **Gradual Migration:** [`MessageHandler`](src/bot/messageHandler.js) supports both services
- **Feature Flags:** Can switch between old and new systems via constructor options

### Deployment Approach
1. **Phase 1:** Deploy new architecture alongside existing system
2. **Phase 2:** A/B test with percentage of traffic
3. **Phase 3:** Full migration after validation
4. **Phase 4:** Remove legacy code after stability period

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```javascript
const SmartBypassService = require('./services/SmartBypassService');

const service = new SmartBypassService();
await service.initialize();

const result = await service.bypassPaywall('https://nytimes.com/article');
if (result.success) {
  console.log(`Bypassed via ${result.method}: ${result.result}`);
}
```

### Adding New Bypass Methods
```javascript
// 1. Create new method class extending BypassMethod
class NewServiceMethod extends BypassMethod {
  constructor() {
    super('new_service', { priority: 7, timeout: 15000 });
  }
  
  async attempt(url, options) {
    // Implementation here
    return this.createResult(success, result, error);
  }
}

// 2. Place in src/services/bypassMethods/
// 3. Auto-registration handles the rest
```

### Health Monitoring
```javascript
// Get comprehensive health status
const health = await service.getHealthStatus();
console.log(`${health.methods.healthyMethods}/${health.methods.totalMethods} methods healthy`);

// Get detailed metrics
const metrics = service.getMetrics();
console.log(`Overall success rate: ${metrics.bypass.overallSuccessRate}%`);
```

## Testing Strategy
