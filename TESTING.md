# PaywallFlower Testing Setup

This document describes the comprehensive testing setup that has been added to the PaywallFlower project.

## What Was Added

### 1. Testing Framework
- **Jest** testing framework added as a dev dependency
- Jest configuration file ([`jest.config.js`](jest.config.js)) with proper Node.js environment setup
- Test scripts added to [`package.json`](package.json):
  - `npm test` - Run all tests
  - `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
  - `npm run test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage report

### 2. Test Structure
```
tests/
├── setup.js                    # Global test setup and mocks
├── README.md                   # Testing documentation
├── bot/
│   └── messageHandler.test.js  # Discord message handling tests
├── services/
│   └── paywallDetector.test.js # Paywall detection service tests
├── utils/
│   └── urlExtractor.test.js    # URL utility function tests
├── integration/
│   └── whitelist.test.js       # Whitelist integration tests
└── index.test.js               # Main bot class tests
```

### 3. Test Coverage

#### Unit Tests
- **[`tests/utils/urlExtractor.test.js`](tests/utils/urlExtractor.test.js)**: 108 lines
  - Tests URL extraction from Discord messages
  - Tests URL normalization (removing tracking parameters)
  - Tests domain extraction functionality
  - Covers edge cases and error handling

- **[`tests/services/paywallDetector.test.js`](tests/services/paywallDetector.test.js)**: 207 lines
  - Tests whitelist domain checking
  - Tests known paywall domain detection
  - Tests heuristic paywall detection with mocked HTTP requests
  - Tests priority handling (whitelist > known domains > heuristics)
  - Comprehensive error handling and edge cases

- **[`tests/bot/messageHandler.test.js`](tests/bot/messageHandler.test.js)**: 207 lines
  - Tests Discord message processing
  - Tests bot message filtering
  - Tests URL processing and response generation
  - Tests duplicate message prevention
  - Tests error handling and cleanup

- **[`tests/index.test.js`](tests/index.test.js)**: 139 lines
  - Tests main bot class initialization
  - Tests Discord client setup and event handlers
  - Tests bot startup and shutdown procedures
  - Tests error handling in bot lifecycle

#### Integration Tests
- **[`tests/integration/whitelist.test.js`](tests/integration/whitelist.test.js)**: 108 lines
  - Converted from the original [`test_whitelist.js`](test_whitelist.js)
  - Tests complete whitelist functionality
  - Tests known paywall domain detection
  - Tests domain extraction with various URL formats
  - Performance tests for quick domain checking

### 4. Mocking Strategy
- **Discord.js**: Fully mocked to prevent actual Discord API calls
- **Axios**: Mocked for HTTP request testing
- **Config**: Mocked with test-specific configurations
- **Logger**: Silenced during tests to reduce noise
- **External services**: All external dependencies properly mocked

### 5. Test Setup
- **[`tests/setup.js`](tests/setup.js)**: Global test configuration
  - Environment variable setup for testing
  - Mock configurations for all external dependencies
  - Console logging management during tests

## How to Run Tests

### Prerequisites
```bash
npm install
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (for development)
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test files
npx jest tests/utils/urlExtractor.test.js
npx jest tests/services/paywallDetector.test.js
```

## Migration from Original Test

The original [`test_whitelist.js`](test_whitelist.js) file has been:
1. **Converted** to a proper Jest test suite in [`tests/integration/whitelist.test.js`](tests/integration/whitelist.test.js)
2. **Enhanced** with additional test cases and better structure
3. **Integrated** with the overall test suite
4. **Removed** from the root directory

The new integration test provides the same functionality but with:
- Better error reporting
- Individual test case isolation
- Performance testing
- More comprehensive edge case coverage

## Benefits

1. **Automated Testing**: Tests can be run automatically in CI/CD pipelines
2. **Regression Prevention**: Changes can be validated against existing functionality
3. **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation of expected behavior
4. **Confidence**: Developers can make changes with confidence knowing tests will catch issues
5. **Debugging**: Failed tests provide clear information about what went wrong

## Next Steps

To complete the testing setup:
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run tests to verify everything works: `npm test`
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline to run tests automatically
4. Consider adding more integration tests for other services as needed

The testing framework is now ready for use and can be extended as the project grows.
